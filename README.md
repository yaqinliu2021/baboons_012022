matlab code for project baboons
The matlab data file "allevents.m" contains all events data from Keiding's
The matlab data file "baboon.m" contains death+emigration events data from Keiding's
The matlab data file "auj.m" contiains indicator of dealth+emigration events as in all events
The matlab code file "MLestimate" solves for beta, gamma, c with the log likelihood A.1 in paper
The matlab code file "rescale_death" rescales death(+emigration) event times with parameters from MLestimate
The matlab code file "resclae_de_K" rescales death(emigration) event times with Keiking's parameter estimates
The matlab code file "plot_de" plots figure 1 in the paper
